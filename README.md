# Hand-Gesture-Based-Calculator-
This project implements a calculator that takes input from hand gestures using OpenCV and Mediapipe. Instead of relying on a machine learning model, the system detects and counts the number of open fingers and maps different finger combinations to corresponding numerical values and operations.
